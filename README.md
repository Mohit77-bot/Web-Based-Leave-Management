# Web Based Leave Management System

A web-based application designed to automate employee leave requests, approvals, and tracking. The system enables secure login for both employees and administrators, reducing paperwork and improving transparency.

##  Objective

The main objective of this project is to design and implement an Advanced Leave Management System that automates the process of managing employee leave requests. The system provides secure login for employees and administrators, enabling employees to apply for leaves and administrators to review, approve, or reject them. Email notifications and simple analytics help improve communication and decision-making.

###  Key Objectives
- Simplify leave application and approval workflow  
- Reduce manual paperwork and delays  
- Ensure transparency between employees and HR/admin  
- Provide easy access to leave history and status  
- Enable data storage and retrieval using an SQLite database  

## Conclusion:
The Advanced Leave Management System successfully achieves automation of the leave process in an organization. It provides: 
- A user-friendly interface for employees to apply for leaves. 
- A centralized dashboard for administrators to view and manage requests. 
- Automatic email notifications ensuring transparency. 
- Secure authentication and data storage. 

## FUTURE SCOPE 
- Integration with Biometric or Attendance Systems To automatically verify attendance before approving leave. 
- Mobile App Integration Develop an Android/iOS app using Flutter or React Native for mobile accessibility. 
- Analytics Dashboard Add data visualization (using Python libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly) to analyze leave trends. 
- Cloud Deployment Deploy on AWS, Heroku, or Azure for large-scale organizational access. 
- AI-based Predictions Implement a model to predict employee absence patterns and optimize workforce planning.
